# Missing-Person-Report-Tool
Python code project: Missing Person Report System
 Project Description
 
The Missing Person Report System is a beginner-friendly Python application designed to help communities report, track, and search for missing individuals. It provides a simple way to store and retrieve reports using a local file without needing the internet or databases.

This project is highly relevant to Ethiopian communities and others where people may go missing due to migration, displacement, or poor communication infrastructure. The system allows users to:

* Report someone who is missing
* Search if a report already exists
* Let a missing person check if someone is searching for them
* View all reports submitted
* Exit with a friendly goodbye message
